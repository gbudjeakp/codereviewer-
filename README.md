# Experience
A simple social media application that let's users share pictures of their activities and also let's them like other users pictures.
This application was created using React for the front-end, Redux to manage the state of various components, 
express and node to set up the backend that handles the user requests and mongodb to save the user data.

# Running Locally
Simply change your directory to the client directory and type `yarn start` to get the front-end running locally.
This should open u a port on `http://localhost:3000/`displaying the front end.

open another terminal and cd the into the server directory then type `nodemon index.js` or `node index.js` to get the backend running locally.
This should open u a port on `http://localhost:5000/` connecting the backend to the database.
